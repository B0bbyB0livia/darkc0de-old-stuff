I. INTRODUCTION
Thank you for choosing PySumpas!  
PySumpas is a very simple program written in Python/Tkinter.
It uses Python's built-in hashlib module to create checksums from user
input, then creates a combined checksum of the two generated checksums.
The combined checksum can be used, in part or as a whole, for passwords.
Currently md5sum is the only supported checksum method.  See the TODO
section for future plans.

II. INSTALLATION
Each user differs in how they wish to install applications from outside
the repositories of their chosen system.  For this reason I will not
include an install script for PySumpas.  Provided below, however, is a
common method.  Make sure both pysumpas.py and the pysumpas script are
executable before installing.
As root:
cp /path/to/pysumpas.py /usr/local/bin 
cp /path/to/pysumpas.sh /usr/local/bin

III. USING PYSUMPAS
The use of PySumpas is simple.
In a terminal:
pysumpas   
From there, simply input the two words of you choice in the two entry
boxes.  Click either "Generate MD5" or "Generate SHA1" depending on the 
type of checksum you wish to produce. The checksum should appear in the 
message box below the buttons.  The resulting checksum can be used as a
password.  Should the password be lost or forgotten, simply entering the
original words should regenerate the original hash.

IV. TODO
As of PySumpas 0.2.0, both MD5 and SHA1 checksums are supported.  Future
plans include further support of the FIPS secure hash algorithms.  Other
features may be made available upon user request.

V. CONTACT
I would like to hear any feedback, whether comments, suggestions, bugs,
or wishlists.  You may contact me via e-mail at n.q.liebert@gmail.com.
