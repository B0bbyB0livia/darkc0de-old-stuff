PyPcap
---------
AUTHOR: Aaron L. Rhodes <arhodes@austin.rr.com>

This is a Python module that interfaces to libpcap, the UNIX packet capture
library.  This can be used for many purposes including network debugging,
traffic analysis, intrusion detection.

It is currently in a very rudimentary state.  BPF filtering does not
work, and the module seg faults on Solaris.

The packet capture uses libpcap but allows you to specify a Python
function as the handler.
