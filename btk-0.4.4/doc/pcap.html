<h1>Libpcap Interface</h1>
Readers who are already familiar with libpcap know of its power and flexibility.
Well, you can use it from within Python now. Please note that if you only use
btk for libpcap it may be a option to use pylibpcap (see References) instead. That package is 
a SWIG (Simplified Wrapper Interface Generator) generated wrapper for libpcap. The reason for programming a whole btk interface to libpcap was to have better
access to the raw power of libpcap. Besides, I'm planning some other functions
combining the libpcap usage and the raw packet usage. We'll see if it works out!
<br><br>
While writing the btk wrappers I tried to stick as much as possible to the 
normal pcap functions names as used in the C-interface. Every function in libpcap is preceded by pcap_ and that isn't needed when using the Python interface.
It's clear the functions belong to the pcap interface because they reside in the
pcap class within btk.
<pre>
>>> import btk
>>> pcap = btk.pcap()
>>> dir(pcap)
>>> ['close', 'compile', 'datalink', 'dispatch', 'dump', 'dump_close', 'dump_open', 'findalldevs', 'getnonblock', 'is_swapped', 'lookupdev', 'lookupnet', 'loop', 'major_version', 'minor_version', 'next', 'open_live', 'open_offline', 'setfilter', 'setnonblock', 'snapshot', 'stats']
</pre>
All useful functions from libpcap are being wrapped. The other ones like pcap_geterr(), pcap_open_dead() aren't very useful for the Python user. BTK takes care
of all error handling and returns nice error strings so you don't have to worry
about that.
Now let's stick to another example
<pre>
>>> import btk
>>> pcap = btk.pcap()
>>> pcap.findalldevs()
['eth0']
>>> pcap.open_live("eth0")
>>> pcap.compile("port 80")
>>> pcap.setfilter()
>>> pcap.next()
</pre>
The example above will first look for suitable devices for use with pcap. After
that it'll initialize the pcap capture interface. The filtering is done for
port www and the set of filter rules is applied using setfilter(). When calling
pcap.next() btk waits for the first packet to pass the filter and it'll return
it so you can parse it.
Note that you've got to have the correct permissions to use the pcap class. Most
of the time this means being root (or setuid bit to root) even for looking up
devices. This is because libpcap shows only the devices accessible through libpcap for the calling user.
