<h1>Preface</h1>
This is the documentation distributed with the Billy the Kid packet.
It'll try to explain the installation and usage of btk (which is farely
easy if you ask me) so you can play around with it. Please note that
Billy the Kid should run on most *nix like systems such as Linux, FreeBSD
and OpenBSD. At the moment the tested platforms are FreeBSD 4.3 (with
standard kernel) and Debian 2.2r5 with Linux 2.2.19. Libpcap's behaviour
isn't (almost) affected when using newer kernels. Well enough loose talking
done.... let's get done to it now!
Oh and when finding grammar errors in this doc mail me. (And you'll find
them :)
