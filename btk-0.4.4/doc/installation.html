<h1>Installation</h1>
Installing btk is farely simple, assumed you're having a correctly
installed Python distribution (>= 2.0) with distutils. You also need
to have libpcap (>= 0.7.1) installed, but with most *nix distro's its already
installed because you need it for tools like tcpdump and snort.
Switch to root and do:

<pre>
host:~/btk# python ./setup.py install
</pre>

This will trigger the distutils build system and it'll build and install
btk in the correct places on your system. If no serious compilation errors
were discovered you're able to check if your system is ready to hack with
btk.

<pre>
host:~/btk# python
Python 2.2 (#1, Feb 19 2002, 14:14:04)
[GCC 2.95.2 20000220 (Debian GNU/Linux)] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import btk
>>> 
</pre>

No error received when importing python which means its correctly installed!
Installation completed, so let's move on...
